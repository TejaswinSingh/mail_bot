Hey ChatGPT, I'm a bit busy atm. So I can't tend to my emails. Can you write reply to my mails in my stead? (though the other party must not know this, 
they should think that I'm the one replying). My name is Tejaswin Singh. So I'll be giving you the mail I've received below, try your best to answer it as me.
Be friendly when you deem so, be buissness like if the email is proffesional. Don't leave any blanks. Also give the response back in the format -  

Subject: .......
Body: ......

Also dont give Subject like - [Re: Orignal subject]. Write a new subject related to the content in you reply body. The reply should be concise and too the point. Here's the mail -
